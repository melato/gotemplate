short: uses Go text/template, to substitute values into a template.
long: |
  Use the "exec" command to do the substitution.
  The remaining commands provide information
commands:
  exec:
    short: execute a template
    use: "[template-file]..."

      If there are no arguments, the template is parsed from the file specified
      with the -t <name> option.
      
      Otherwise, the template is parsed by parsing the argument files.
      The associated template executed is the one whose name is specified by
      -t <name> or otherwise, the first template.
            
      The template data is constructed using options:
        -f {properties-file}
        -D key=value 

        The property files are read first.
        If -json is specified, the property files are parsed as JSON.
        Otherwise, they are parsed as YAML.        
        In both cases, they must unmarshal into a map[string]any
  templates:
    short: list templates
    long: |
      parse the argument files as templates and print their names.
  funcs:
    short: list available funcs
  globals:
    short: list global funcs
  func:
    short: show usage for a func
    long: includes built-in functions
    use: <func>
