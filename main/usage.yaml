short: substitute variables into a Go template  
long: |
  This program uses Go text/template,
  to substitute values into a template.
  
  The template data is constructed using options:
    -f [key=]{yaml-file}
    -json [key=]{json-file}
    -F key=file
    -D key=value  
  
    All keys used must be unique,
    so that the result will not depend on the options order
    
    The template has the following additional functions, besides builtins:
    
    file(filename string) (string,error)
      reads a file from the filesystem, and returns its content as a string      
    
    yaml(filename string) (map[string]any,error)
      reads a file from the filesystem,
      unmarshals its content as YAML into a map[string]any,
      and returns this result
    
    json(filename string) (any,error)
      reads a file from the filesystem,
      unmarshals its content as any json,
      and returns the result
